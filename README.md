# FPS Character Controller
<!---
Hier komt een korte beschrijving van de proefopdracht. Wat heb je precies gedaan?
-->
It took me about three weeks to make this First Person Character Controller. I learned a lot more about OOP and loosely coupled code. There are some points I can improve on. I hope that I can make a bigger project using my First Person Character Controller and that I have the time to update it.

## Features
<!---
Wanneer je een specifiek onderdeel wilt uitlichten kun je dat in deze sectie benoemen.

- Movement with animations
- Jumping
- Weapon shooting aiming and reloading
- Weapon recoil

## Software Analysis
- Unity

Unity is a 3D game engine that makes it easier to create anything 3D specific. C# is a great language for OOP that will make it easier to keep track of everything if this project gets bigger.

- Unreal Engine

Unreal Engine is much the same as Unity but more optimized for performance. I am not building a AAA game so this won't be needed, but Unreal is a great engine for FPS games.

- Phaser

This engine is not made for 3D games. There are libraries like three.js but that will still be a bad choice performance wise. It will take to much time to create everything needed for a 3D game.

- GameMaker

GameMaker is a possibility, but this engine is not very good for 3D performance. Other engine wich are made for 3D would be a better choice. In GameMaker you have to program everything like the locations of 3D objects. This will take way to much time.

The most efficient engine I could find is Unity or Unreal. These engines are both 3D optimized and they have a lot of build-in functions and classes for 3D games like raycasts that you need for an FPS Character Controller

## Learning Goals
<!---
Wat wil je bereiken met dit project? Formuleer dit kort, krachtig en haalbaar.
- Het Flood-Fill algoritme snappen en toepassen
- Het ontwikkelen van een generieke FSM.
- etc. etc.
-->
- Understanding how to create an FPS Character Controller.
- Creating loosely coupled game mechanics.

## Planning 
First three weeks.

| | Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|Week 1 | Research and Planning | A simple playarea to work in | Basic movement | Basic movement and camera rotation | Movement and jump animations
|Week 2 | --- | --- | --- | Loosely coupled movement | Last changes to anything related to movement
|Week 3 | Weapon sway and aiming | Weapon Shooting | Finishing Project and Readme | Portfolio Start | Portfolio Finish
